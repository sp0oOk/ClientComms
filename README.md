Cosmic Client Communication Plugin

# Information
Reverse engineered API of the infamous `Cosmic Client 1.8.9`, this is by no means a functional plugin. A project me and a friend did when we were bored to pass time, it will not work UNLESS you have an IP in CosmicPvPs own range. However, if you make an agent to edit the class you can bypass this check with ease.
